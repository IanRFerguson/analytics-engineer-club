# Lesson 2 - Using Git

## Why use git?

* Understand the story of your code

* Undo mistakes easily

* Have ONE clean representation of your work ... no more "final.py" "final_final.py" etc

* Code review is a best practice

* Great for collaboration across multiple developers

## Mental Models

* Make a local change

* Group a set of changes into a "commit" ... this is a set of changes that you make to a project

```bash
# Stage all local changes
git add .

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "I made some changes"
```

* You want to PULL changes before starting work / making other changes

* You want to PUSH changes after your changes are complete (for now)
