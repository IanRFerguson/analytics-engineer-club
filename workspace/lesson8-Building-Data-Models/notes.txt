Think about the structural tradeoffs between different approaches... Size of table, ease of use for end user, how "cluttered" is your table?

** You model data to implement business logic **

* Decisions that your company makes to try and align on definitions
* Both at the "grain" level and the "column" level 
    ** Grain == What counts as an "order"? How are we operationalizing business outcomes
    ** Column == How do we measure something like revenue? Does it include taxes?

#####

* Most data teams...
    ** Are source data centric
    ** Mostly do cleaning work / joining manually
    ** Often only one query between source data and data powering a dashboard

* The best data teams...
    ** Are business centric
    ** Have clear definitions of what one record represents (what's a customer?)
    ** Intentional about separating source and business logic in transformations

#####

* Distinction between SOURCE and BUSINESS logic
    ** Source tied to systems that produce data (think transformations, renaming fields for consistency)
    ** Business logic is more subjective & requires stakeholder input to align on a definition
