1 - Understanding your stakeholder needs

* Draw a mock dashboard / prototype

* Ask questions 
    ** What will you do differently with this information?
    ** How do you usually get this information?

#####

2 - Check availability of your source data

#####

3 - Mock the end result that you're working towards

* What table maps to this visualization?

* What do you NEED to create this visualization or dashboard?

#####

4 - Mock the SQL you would need to accomplish this

* Write pseudocode!

* Detail what you need and why you need it

#####

5 - Iterate on your data model

* Dimensions, facts, what you'll *do* with facts (averages, medians, ranges, etc.)

#####

6 - Start sketching out a dbt DAG

* What models / tables feed into the resulting output left to right?

* Start building sources (the left-most parts of our DAG)

#####

7 - Declare sources && build staging models

* Add YAML files to your dbt project for your source data
    ** Ensure any assumptions about your source data is recorded and validated here
    ** Add information about these sources as you learn more about them

* Staging models clean up your source data into "the shape you wish it came in"
    ** Same grain as your source data
    ** Renamed fields, reordered columns, etc.
    ** Should be tested and documented

* Staging vs. marts
    ** Think about it like source data vs. data to hand off for business problems
