What is data modeling?

* Preprocessing + transofrming data prior to querying
* Implement agreed upon definitions of what gets counted as a sale

* Modeling == higher level of intention
    ** Why am I creating this in the big picture?

Solution 1 - One Big Table

* One centralized table with everything you would need to answer questions

* Pros
    ** Easy to right
    ** Easy to extend

* Cons
    ** Can quickly become unwieldy and hard to navigate
    ** BI tools often ask you to define your joins
    ** Challenging when the dimensions can update without warning (e.g., product changing category)

#####

Solution 2 - Star Schema

* Many reference tables feed into one aggregate table (this is similar to how we work at ML)

* Pros
    ** Many people can write this code
    ** Very easy to navigate
    ** This design is handy when the dimenions change without warning

* Cons
    ** SQL proficiency is pretty mandatory in order to accomplish this

#####

Solution 3 - Kimball's approach

* Also a star Schema

* Two new terms:
    ** Fact = The columns that get aggregated (sales amounts)
    ** Dimensions = The columes that you group by (sales person, store location, vendor, etc.)

Best practices

* Models should have clear grain
* Models should use consistent naming conventions
* Models should anticipate multiple questions from a stakeholder
* Models should be "idempotent" ... i.e., if you drop them you could rebuild them from scratch
