GIT MENTAL MODEL

* Make a local change

* Group a set of changes into a "commit" ... this is a set of changes that you make to a project
	** `git add .`
	** `git commit -m "I made some changes"

* You want to PULL changes before starting work / making other changes

* You want to PUSH changes after your changes are complete (for now)
