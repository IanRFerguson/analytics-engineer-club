What is dbt?

* dbt == data build tool

* Command line tool to transform data quickly and efficiently

* Select statements are stored as dbt models
	** Handles turning select statements into tables and views
	** Understands the order and dependencies of each model
	** Allows for testing
	** Can generate project documentation automatically

* To use dbt...
	** Must be installed locally
	** You need a dbt project that contains models
	** Credentials to a data warehouse

* A dbt project is just a few things
	** dbt_project.yml is a YMAL file that configures the dbt pipeline
	** A model is a single select statement stored in a .sql file

* The way that dbt materializes the results of a query is set via model configurations
	** Option 1 - using a config block within a model

	{{ config(
		materialized='table'
		)
	}}

	** Option 2 - Changing the models key in the YAML file

	models:
		coffe_shop:
			materialized: view


* All configuration options: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs

* Use the ref function to take the name of another model as an argument
	
	from {{ ref('users') }}

* DAGs == Directed Acyclic Graphs

* In short, a DAG is a graph where tasks are shown as nodes, and dependencies are shown as arrows
