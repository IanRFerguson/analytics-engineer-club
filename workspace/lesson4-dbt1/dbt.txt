Introduction to DBT

* Once a query is stored in a DBT project they are called `models`

* Lots of things to do ... change from views to tables, infer which order to build models in, test / document models

* DBT can generate documentation of your workflow! (Lineage Graphs)


##########


* What you need
	** DBT installed locally
	** DBT project with queries (models)
	** Connection to data warehouse

`dbt run`


##########


* `pip install dbt-bigquery`

* `dbt init` to create a project
	** This creates a YAML file with parameters to fine-tune as you need (name, version, clean_targets, etc.)

* `models` directory should contain your SQL queries


##########


* You can add configurations one of two ways
	** In a `config` block at the top of your model
	** In the relevant YAML file for the project

* You can abstract the dependent models in your project with `{{ ref('filename') }}

* DAG [[ need to define ]]
	** Boiling water / making coffee analogy
	** Downstream events (e.g., transformations) depend on both
	** They happen independently upstream
